I like a ton of British comedies. Big ones are: The IT Crowd, The Mighty Boosh, Inside No. 9/Psychoville/The League of Gentlemen, Peep Show, and a lot more that are comedy adjacent (Taskmaster and Doctor Who \[modern and classic]).

Before you interact, please know:
----
IWEC *always* for I have severe social anxiety and probably won't respond to anything aside from crowns. 

I am extremely critical of all the media I consume.

DNI only applies to under 13s and profics.

I'm not really on any social media nor will I ever have a Rentry or Strawpage. Please do not ask me for any of my socials unless I'm comfortable.
